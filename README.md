# micro-bit-Watch
An implementation of a digital watch on a BBC micro:bit

On a whim I nipped out and bought the only BBC micro:bit in stock at PB Tech in New Plymouth as I was curious to have a play and see where it might fit in between Raspberry Pi’s and Arduino’s for teaching kids.

I thought turning it into a simple digital watch would be a fun place to start learning.
